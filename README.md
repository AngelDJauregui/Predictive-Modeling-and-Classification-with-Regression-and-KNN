# Predictive-Modeling-and-Classification-with-Regression-and-KNN
Predictive Modeling and Classification with Regression and KNN using Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Google Colab.
- Used Linear/Ridge Regression Models on 20,000+ housing records, optimizing model via alpha tuning to prevent overfitting.
- Improved model accuracy through feature scaling, cross validation, and MSE-based evaluation.
- Built a KNN classifier to categorize 130+ Iris samples across 3 species, fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- Visualized complex relationships with decision bounderies and confusion matrices to evaluate model precision and recall.
